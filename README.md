# Census_Data_Insights
In this Project, I used SQL fucntions to derive insights from census data literacy rate, growth rate etc. Tools Used: SQL Server Management Studio, Microsoft Excel.
Task: Deriving Population Insights from census data. 
• Analysis: I applied various SQL functions like aggregate function, window functions like rank, subqueries, operators (Like), alias, joins, and clauses like group by, order by, having, insert, delete, limit, etc. 
• Conclusion: I successfully derived insight such as total male/female population and total literacy rate per district and state, the growth rate in different parameters like literacy, population, and gender-wise.
